## What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?
for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.

There are four transition related properties in total, including transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. Not all of these are required to build a transition, with the first three are the most popular.
