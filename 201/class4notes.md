## Class 4 Notes

To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?
<p>
  I'm creating a link to
  <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">the Mozilla homepage</a>.
</p>

The element is <a> for anchor and is attributed with href="url". Followed by a caption and a closing </a> tag.

The href attribute contains what information?
Hyper reference or url address of where the link is to go.

What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
By Noting the site or describing the link so that the reader can access the link clearly. Also by making it screen readable.

What is meant by “normal flow”?
The way the webpage elements lay themselves out if you haven't changed their layout.

What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?
* block-level elements fill the available inline space of the parent element.
* Inline elements is based on the size of their content.
* You can't set width or height on inline elements
* display: block; or display: inline-block are two ways to control the size of an inline element.

___ positioning is the default for every html element.
Static positioning is the default that every element gets.

Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.
* You can create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page.
* Rather than positioning the element based on its relative position within the normal document flow, they specify the distance the element should be from each of the containing element's sides.
* If no ancestor elements have their position property defined, then by default all ancestor elements will have a static position. Containing the element in the initial containing block.

What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?
Fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport. (An exception to this occurs if one of the element's ancestors is a fixed containing block because its transform property has a value other than none.)


Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.
Invoke means to run or execute
function declaration is calling the function

What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
Parameters are values that need to be included inside the function parentheses to do its job properly. Parameters are sometimes called arguments, properties, or even attributes. 

### Greater Efficiency

Pair programing makes catching mistakes easier while producing higher-quality code that leads to less troubleshooting, debugging, and overlooking mistakes. Pairing also enhances technical skills, team communication, and enjoyability of coding in the workplace. I think this will get me used to seeing errors early on and further develop my literacy.

### Social Skills

It improves social skills. Gets you used to a different coding style. Develops interpersonal skills. It is essential to hire people who can work well with others. I think this could help me by getting me out of my shell and not being afraid to ask questions and work toward a solution.
