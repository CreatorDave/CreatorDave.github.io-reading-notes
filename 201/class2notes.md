# Class 2 notes

## JavaScript

JavaScript is a **loosely typed** and **dynamic** language

-Loosely type - we don't need to know the type of data before declaring a vraiable
-Dynamic - you can change the type after it has been declared

- 
let cat;

- 'cat = 3;'

-'cat = 'meow';`

## Data Types

### Strings

- sequence of characters used to represent text. Written using single quotes.
- `'hello'`, `'

### Numbers

- numeric data type
- full numbers, decimals, negatices

### Boolean

- logical data types
-true // false
- truthy // falsy

### Undefined

- it has not been deifined yet

### Null

- has been defined but defined as none

Numbers
0 - is the only falsey value
any other number is considered truthy

Strings 
'' - is the only falsey value
any other string is considered truthy

Comparison operators - what are some examples?
>=, <=, < , >
!== strictly not equal - this is our world
!= loosely not equal - comparative not equal - not out world!
=== strictly equal - THis is our world
== loosely/Comparative equal - not out world
