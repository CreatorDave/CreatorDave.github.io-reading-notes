## Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through — you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!
Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.

## List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
Syntax errors where I was missing a semi-colon and a closing tag
Logic errors where I passed a string in for a number and didn't know how to resolve this issue without changing the string into a number "manually."


## How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
Getting comfortable with errors and making mistakes in order to learn from them will aid in developing a mindset that continues off the growth mindset.

## How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
The JavaScript debugger allows you to watch the value of variables and set breakpoints, places in your code that you want to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly.

To get to the debugger:

Firefox: SelectFirefox menu icon that has more options to customize and control Firefox.➤ Web Developer ➤ Debugger or press Ctrl + Shift + S to open the JavaScript Debugger. If the tools are already displayed, click on the Debugger tab.

Chrome: Open the Developer tools and then select the Sources tab. (Opera works the same way.)

Edge and Internet Explorer 11: Press F12 and then, Ctrl + 3, or if the tools are already displayed, click on the Debugger tab.

Safari: Open the Developer Tools and then select the Debugger tab.


## Define what a breakpoint is.
Set breakpoints where you want to pause execution.

## What is the call stack?
The Call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line. You can see that the code is in the function that handles a mouse click, and that the code is currently paused on the breakpoint.
