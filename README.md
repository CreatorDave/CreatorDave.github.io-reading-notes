Growth mindset
  A growth mindset is embracing challenges, persisting through obstacles, maintaining effort (no pain, no gain), and learning from criticism.
  While also being inspired by the success of others. This aids in achieving more and attaining higher goals.
  
  Reminders:
  1. - [X] I will ðŸ¥‡ approach problems with the motivation to accept the challenge
  2. - [ ] I will ðŸ¥ˆlisten to criticism and learn from my mistakes
  3. - [ ] I will ðŸ¥‰ be inspired by others successes
