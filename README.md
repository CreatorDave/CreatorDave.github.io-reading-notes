# Reading Notes

Hi,

My name is David Sitthideth and I am a software developer. Looking to grow in my field. Here is a link to my github portfolio page.
Portfolio page [Github Pages](https://github.com/CreatorDave) My previous background includes being a mechanic in the United States Air Force and the United States Coast Guard. For the Air force the mission was training F-16 fighter pilots and for the Coast Guard the mission was drug interdiction. Following this, I worked in higher education and then law as a patent assistant. Today I'm developing my skills in software development. Looking forward to the future and the many things we'll build!

Growth mindset
  A growth mindset is embracing challenges, persisting through obstacles, maintaining effort (no pain, no gain), and learning from criticism.
  While also being inspired by the success of others. This aids in achieving more and attaining higher goals.
  
  Reminders:
  1. - [X] I will ðŸ¥‡ approach problems with the motivation to accept the challenge
  2. - [ ] I will ðŸ¥ˆlisten to criticism and learn from my mistakes
  3. - [ ] I will ðŸ¥‰ be inspired by others successes
