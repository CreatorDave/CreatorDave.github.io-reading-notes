# JavaScript

JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with fir-class functions. The back-end portions consist of Node.js, Apache CouchDB, and Adobe Acrobat is a non-browser environment. Where HTMl is the skeleton, CSS the muscles, JavaScript is the nervous system that allows the whole body to function. JavaScript helps you animate or interact with the website and allows you to take inputs and give outputs to data received by the user.
