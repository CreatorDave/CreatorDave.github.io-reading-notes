## Expressions and Operators

Assignment, comparison, arithmetic, bitwise, logical, string, ternary are some of the expressions and operators that you'll use in JavaScript. An expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely *evaluate*.

For example:
The expression X = 7 has a side effect. This expression uses the = *operator* to assign the value seven to the variable x. The expression evaluates to 7. 

While the expression 3 + 4 is an example of purely *evaluate*. 

There is precedence in operators much like PEMDAS in mathematics. The example: 

> const x = 1 + 2 * 3;
> const y = 2 * 3 + 1;

Both evaluates to 7.

### Comparison operators are === and !==

These operators do not attempt to convert the operands to compatible types before checking equality. The basis here is whether something is true or false.

Examples:
Equal ==
Not equal !=
Strict equal ===
Strict not equal !==
Greater than (>)
Greater than or equal (>=)
Less than (<)
Less than or equal (<=)

Arithmetic operators
**+** addition
**-** subtraction
* multiplication
/ division
