## CSS

### What is CSS?

CSS or Cascading Style Sheets all you to create great-looking web pages with style and vim. Where HTML is the structure or skeleton of the site, CSS is the style or muscles that make up the body. CSS can be used for very basic document text styling. Changing size or color of headings and links. While also changing the body of the document as well.

### CSS Syntax

CSS is a rule-based language. You can assign these rules to different groups and and elements. Here is an example

h1 {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 5em;
}

The rule opens with a 'selector' then curly braces {}. Inside the curly braces are one or more 'declarations' which take the form of 'property' and 'value' pairs. We specify the property (color) before the colon and we specify the value of the property after the colon (blue).
