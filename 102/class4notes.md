## Wireframes & Design, Mozilla HTML Basics, Semantics

**Wireframes**
Three key principles

1. Clarity

Clarity means knowing what the site is there for, if it meets the needs of the user, and what the site is. The wireframe is an aid to visualize the page layout while providing important answers for SMART goals that the site wants to address. This focus on goals separates aesthetics from content and allows for better recognition of both.

2. Confidence

Simplicity brings confidence. Therefore, navigating the site with clear calls-to-action create an environment where things are meant to get done. Make it predictable. Provide an intuitive flow to the structure so everything is laid out in a manner that is simple and easy to use.

3. Simplicity is key

Too many buttons, too many links, and too much information can cause an overload to the user. Not to mention a big distraction for what they might be trying to do. Minimizing or eliminating fluff can set you up for an aesthetically pleasing site.

Remember your wireframe is a visual guide to the framework of your site and how it will be navigated. More consideration for simplicity means less confusion for the user.

Tags, tags, and more tags

Tags are like sandwiches. You put one slice of bread at the bottom and another at the top to complete the sandwich. That's the same with tags. One opening tag at the beginning and the closing tag at the end. In this way you can nest tags within other tags and enhance the structure of your HTML document.

**Here's an example:**
Wrap the text in an <a> element, as shown below:
<a>Mozilla Manifesto</a>
Give the <a> element an href attribute, as shown below:
<a href="">Mozilla Manifesto</a>
Fill in the value of this attribute with the web address that you want the link to:
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla Manifesto</a>

**Semantics**

Semantic elements help to organize and differentiate the tags in your HTML document.

Semantic elements in HTML:
<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<mark>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>
<time>
