## Welcome to What is a Text Editor

A text editor is a piece of software that allows you to write and manage text to build a website. 
The text editor uses scripting languages to function on the web. Those languages are HyperText MarkUp Language
and Cascading Style Sheets. In short, they are HTML and CSS. Along with a couple others. When a text editor
is written in these languages and then saved as "index.html" or "style.css" then the computer knows to interpret
the language so that it can be posted to the internet. The thing to note is that the file is saved in .html or .css.
Editors come in all shapes and sizes but so long as you can get the job done then you'll find that you might favor
one editor over another. Notepad++ is for windows computers only. TextWrangler, which is now discontinued but absorbed by BB, 
was for Macs only. The rest work for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

While a text editor is enough to get the job done, not too bulky, and easy to use, an IDE or Integrated Development Environment
is really a suite of various software all in one. If you're familiar with other applications like Microsoft Outlook then you'll
be able to recognize that it is a an email client, calendar, task manger, and to-do list. An IDE is similar in fashion.
Finding the tool that works best for you will come with time. I encourage you to try various ones out and over time you'll
become comfortable knowing you've found one that you enjoy.
